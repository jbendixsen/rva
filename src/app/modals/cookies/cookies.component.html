      <h3 class="modal-title">What Are Cookies?</h3>
      <p class="cookies-section-text">Cookies are small, usually randomly encoded, text files that help you navigate through a website. They are generated on the sites that you visit, as well as by third-parties that websites work with, to manage key elements of their business-user functionality. In most cases, they do not involve or use personal information in any way.</p>
      <p class="cookies-section-text">Cookies are used extensively online and have become part of the fabric and make-up of what has made the Internet work effectively for consumers and businesses. Without cookies, many areas of functionality (for example, user logins, shopping baskets and other customization features) would not work as expected.</p>
      <p class="cookies-section-text">Further information on cookies can be found at the EU Internet Handbook or AllAboutCookies.org.</p>

      <h3 class="modal-title">What Are The Types Of Cookies?</h3>
      <h4 class="cookies-section-title">Session Cookies</h4>
      <p class="cookies-section-text">Session cookies are temporary cookies that are not stored on your computer or mobile device. Certain session cookies are also used to understand, for example, if a user interacting with our company website is a new visitor or a visitor returning as part of the same browsing session. These session cookies are erased when you close your browser, or after extended inactivity.</p>
      <h4 class="cookies-section-title">Persistent Cookies</h4>
      <p class="cookies-section-text">Persistent cookies are those placed on your computer or mobile device for a pre-determined length of time when you visit this site. They are used to understand (through Google Analytics) what areas of our websites and platform are most popular, and how customers and users engage with them.</p>
      <h4 class="cookies-section-title">Cookie management</h4>
      <p class="cookies-section-text">You have the ability to accept or decline the use of cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, many web browsers can be configured to notify you each time a cookie is tendered, and permit you to accept or decline them on an individual basis or on a site-by-site basis. If you choose to decline cookies from {{ domainName }}’s websites, you may experience some unexpected behaviors or impact to the use of the hosted SaaS software.</p>
      <h4 class="cookies-section-title">Additional Tracking</h4>
      <p class="cookies-section-text">Other tracking technologies are used on {{ domainName }}’s company website and SaaS platform sites. These are primarily used to understand if customers or users are interacting with any marketing-type emails sent from our systems. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flash Locally Stored Objects (eg ‘Flash’ cookies) – these follow the same principle as normal standard cookies in that they allow information to be stored on a user’s machine.</li>
        <li>Transparent GIF or web beacons- these mechanisms can be used to deliver a cookie to your browser. They can also be used in email marketing to identify to the sender if an email has been opened.</li>
      </ul>
